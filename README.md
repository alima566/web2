# web2

This repo contains all the assignments I completed in my web 2 (COMP 3512) class.

Each assignment builds upon the other.

Assignment 1: This is a mock art store project that retrieves all the data from a database.

Assignment 2: Working in a group, it builds upon the previous assignment by using PHP sessions and adds a working "Add to Cart" and a "Add to Favourites" button.

Assignment 3: Essentially the same assignment as the previous one, but converting some of the PHP code into JavaScript and added some other JavaScript features.

More information about each assignment can be found in the PDF files located within each assignment directory.
